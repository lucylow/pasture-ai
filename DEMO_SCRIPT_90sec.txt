For the judges: here's what PastureAI does in about a minute.

On the left, I'm on the PastureAI demo screen. I drop a single pasture photo from my phone. The app runs a fast, deterministic biomass estimator entirely through Lovable's Cloud API—no GPU, no heavy model training required for the demo.

Within a second, I get a biomass estimate in grams per square meter, a plain-language recommendation like "Rest this paddock five to seven days," and a confidence score. Every prediction is stored locally, so this works offline in the field and farmers keep control of their data.

On the right, you see the cooperative dashboard. We load pilot data for twelve farms and aggregate it into sustainability KPIs: grazing efficiency, overgrazing reduction, biomass stability, and peer-validated practice adoption. After community adoption, grazing efficiency improves by around eighteen percent and overgrazing events drop by over forty percent—numbers a judge can verify directly in the UI with seeded data.

Under the hood, all of this is running on Lovable.dev Cloud with a Supabase backend: tables for farms, paddocks, and weekly metrics; RLS-protected data; and clean API routes for biomass prediction and KPI computation. That means this exact demo is one click away from a real pilot—no architecture rewrite required.

PastureAI turns a single photo into measurable, cooperative sustainability outcomes, and this Lovable-backed repo is ready to ship today.
